Overview
========

The **Dependency** plugin for *CakePHP* provides a dependency injection container and service registry/locator. The plugin includes the [Di](Utility/Di.php) utility class, which is used to register and resolve dependencies.

To inject dependencies you only need a class which is accessible to the framework. This can be from *CakePHP* itself, from a plugin, or even a vendor library.
